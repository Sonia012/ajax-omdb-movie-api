# Description

First half of February 2019: exercise about ajax. The [api to be used is](http://www.omdbapi.com/). 

Below, you'll find the instructions we received from our BeCode coach for this assignment:

        Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to create a movie search engine popcorn. To do so you must use the open API from oMDb. Your web page should work like google :

        - First you must have page with just a search bar where you can enter the name of a movie.
        - After doing the search, the web page should provide a list of movies that have the name in their title (each element of the     list should contain the name of the movie and the year)
        - The elements should be clickable. When clicking, the user will navigate to an other page containing all the information the     movies, with the poster, and the synopsis.

        An icon in the the top left brings the user back to the orignal search page (the one with only the search input)

        Flow : Search => List => Detailed movie
